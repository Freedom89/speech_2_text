# speech_2_text

This is a side project by [Vincent](https://github.com/orgs/Merck-SG-DS/people/VincentFirmansyah) and [Harry](https://github.com/orgs/Merck-SG-DS/people/hungk20) along with me to learn about Machine Learning on words classification given an audio (wav) file. 

The order of the scripts to read should be 

1. Prepare Data - Put in correct Digit folder.ipynb
2. Digit Recognition using DTW.ipynb (failed attempt [DTW](Dynamic_time_warping) - can ignore)
3. Bengali Digits Classification_v2.ipynb (other approaches but failed as well - can ignore)  
4. Remove start-end silence.ipynb (Clean up the features) 
5. Final_Model.ipynb (Final model with 80% accuracy - depends on script.py) 
5. LSTM-1st-attempt.ipynb (using NN to model - NEW )
