# speech_2_text

This is a side project by [Vincent](https://github.com/orgs/Merck-SG-DS/people/VincentFirmansyah) and [Harry](https://github.com/orgs/Merck-SG-DS/people/hungk20) along with me to learn about Machine Learning on words classification given an audio (wav) file. 

The order of the scripts to read should be 

1. Prepare Data - Put in correct Digit folder.ipynb
2. Remove start-end silence.ipynb (visualizations included) 
3. Digit Recognition using DTW.ipynb (failed attempt DTW - )
4. Bengali Digits Classification_v2.ipynb (Using random forest) 
5. LSTM-1st-attempt.ipynb (using NN to model)
